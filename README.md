# LMG_BlochCS
This is a collection of codes we used to study the time evolution of Bloch Coherent states in the Lipki-Meshkov-Glick Model

Prior to the compilation of any code you must first check to make sure you have the following:

1. gfortran compiler
2. Lapack 
3. Blas

In case you do not have them, you can install easily using the following linux commands 

sudo apt-get install gfortran
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev liblapack-dev

# Clone the repository

1. Open a terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want to clone the LMG_BlochCS directory.

2. Clone as:

    git clone https://github.com/djuliannader/LMG_BlochCS.git


# Instructions

Please read the head of each code for a brief description and
compiling instructions

All codes require that the output file do not exist in the same directory 

We recomend to change the name of the output file after each calculation
